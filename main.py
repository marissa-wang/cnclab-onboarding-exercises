### ==================== STEP 1: EXTRACT DATA ==================== ###

def load_data(filename):
    # grating2AFC S11.mat has the data we need in it! But it is binary/archive
    # format, so not directly viewable. Scipy to the rescue :3

    # Transfer data from .mat to variable w/ scipy.io
    grating_all_mat_data = sio.loadmat(filename)

    #print(grating_all_mat_data)
    # The above print statement was used temporarily to set a breakpoint and
    # extrapolate more about what data structure grating_all_mat_data has.
    # Debug mode tells us 'data' = {ndarray: (1,1)}, so we will break this up more.

    # We use grating_all_mat_data['data'] and not grating_all_mat_data[0] since
    # grating_all_mat_data is a dictionary. We extract only the "data" key/category
    # since that is the one of interest.
    grating_all_data = grating_all_mat_data['data']

    # Same concept with extracting specific categories using keys from the
    # dictionary of "data."
    # [0][0][0] at the end is to extract the data from matlab 1x1 structs :(
    #### stim_id -- was grating right or left? (0 = left, 1 = right)
    stim_id = grating_all_data['stimID'][0][0][0]
    #### response -- subject chose which side they thought had grating
    #### (same codes as above)
    response = grating_all_data['response'][0][0][0]
    #### rating -- confidence rating, from 1 (least confident) to 4 (most)
    #### negative value means did not respond in time
    rating = grating_all_data['rating'][0][0][0]
    #### response_rt -- reaction time, between stimulus onset and subject response
    response_rt = grating_all_data['responseRT'][0][0][0]

    # We organize all of this info into a pandas dataframe!
    # Note: pandas.DataFrame expects a dict-like structure;
    # wrapping columns in {} is required to build it correctly.

### ==================== STEP 3: EXECUTE ALL ==================== ###

if __name__ == "__main__":

    ### ==================== Prep ==================== ###

    # "grating2AFC S11" probably stands for:
    #
    # grating -- the sinusoidal visual grating of the experiment
    # 2AFC -- 2-alternative forced choice (task); subject is forced to pick between two
    # S11 -- Subject 11. they ran this on multiple subjects for sure, and this is only one

    # gimme dataframe :3
    loaded_data = load_data("grating2AFC S11.mat")

    # {insert dataframe}.shape returns (rows, columns)
    # [0] is to extract number of rows
    total_trials = loaded_data.shape[0]
    # Why not half_trials, instead of first_half_trials? Because in cases where
    # trial numbers are odd, the first and second "half" would not be the same number.
    # // floors the division, so it will always be exactly half or possibly less
    first_half_trials = total_trials // 2

        "two asterisks (**) above it â€” as the p-val is less than 0.01. This is a "
        "significant result."
